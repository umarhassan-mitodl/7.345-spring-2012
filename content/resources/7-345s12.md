description: The non-coding regions of the genome have undergone an expansion throughout
  evolution, supporting their potential importance in organismal complexity. These
  transcribed non-coding regions give rise to various classes of small or long non-coding
  RNAs. Research during the last decade has been instrumental in elucidating the roles
  of these genes in normal physiology and disease. Image by MIT OpenCourseWare, pie
